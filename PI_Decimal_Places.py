  The Variables Defintions
  -----------------------
  c: cumulative sum (increasingly better approximation)
  t: one term in the sum
  n: numerator
  d: denominator
  na: adjustment to numerator for each term
  da: adjustment to denominator for each term
  one: express 1.0 as a long integer with a given number of places

  Returns:
          The decimal numbers of PI depending on the number of places you put in the function.
